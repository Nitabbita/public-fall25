*If you want to include code in your report, you can insert a screenshot (if it's legible), or you can copy/paste the code into a fenced code block.*

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
# testargs.py

import sys

print ("{} is the name of the script." . format(sys.argv[0]))
print ("There are {} arguments: {}" . format(len(sys.argv), str(sys.argv)))

for ind, arg in enumerate(sys.argv):
    print ("[{}]: {} {}".format(ind,arg,sys.argv[ind]))
```

The table below shows a simple table.

|1|Aug 29|Personal Introduction|
|2|Aug 31|Programming task|
|3|Sep 5|Intro to Web Science|
|3|Sep 7|EC 0.2-0.6|

The table below shows an example confusion matrix (you'll see this term later) from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix>.
